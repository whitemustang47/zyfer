<h1>Project Overview:</h1>

<h1>Project Phases:</h1>

<h3>Planning and Design:</h3>
<p>
  Recognized the growing interest in gesture-controlled devices and identified an opportunity to develop a gesture-controlled RC car.<br>
  Collaboratively brainstormed the project requirements and functionalities to ensure the successful implementation of a gesture-controlled RC car.<br>
  Allocated tasks among team members based on their individual skills and expertise, fostering efficient collaboration throughout the project.
</p>

<h3>Hardware Assembly:</h3>
<p>
  Acquired essential components, including aluminium rods, H-bridge, servo motors for steering, and 2 DC motors for engine, to lay the foundation for the RC car.<br>
  Meticulously constructed the car base using aluminium rods, ensuring a sturdy and durable framework for the subsequent assembly.<br>
  Seamlessly integrated the H-bridge for motor control and meticulously attached servo motors for steering and DC motors for propulsion, ensuring precise control and smooth operation of the RC car.
</p>

<h3>Gesture Recognition Model Development:</h3>
<p>
  Gathered a diverse dataset for gesture recognition, encompassing a wide range of hand movements and gestures.<br>
  Leveraged the powerful Edge Impulse platform to train a robust gesture recognition model, capable of accurately identifying and interpreting various hand gestures.<br>
  Fine-tuned and optimized the model for embedded systems, ensuring efficient performance and low-power consumption on the ESP-EYE board.
</p>

<h3>Integration with ESP-EYE:</h3>
<p>
  Successfully embedded the trained gesture recognition model onto the ESP-EYE board, leveraging its capabilities for real-time gesture detection.<br>
  Configured the ESP-EYE board to seamlessly capture and process hand gestures in real-time, laying the foundation for intuitive control of the RC car.
</p>

<h3>Communication Setup:</h3>
<p>
  Established a reliable communication channel between the ESP-EYE and ESP32 on the RC car, leveraging the ESP-NOW protocol for seamless communication.<br>
  Implemented robust protocols for transmitting gesture commands from the ESP-EYE board to the RC car, ensuring accurate and responsive control in various operating conditions.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Debugging:</h3>
<p>
  Conducted rigorous testing of the entire system to validate functionality and reliability under real-world conditions.<br>
  Identified and addressed hardware and software issues promptly, ensuring the smooth operation of the gesture-controlled RC car.<br>
